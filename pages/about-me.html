                    <p>
                        My journey into technology began before I even started elementary school, sparked by a fascination with PC games. The more I played, the more I wondered about the magic happening inside the machine. This curiosity only grew when I got my first laptop in elementary school, where I spent countless hours exploring and learning about its inner workings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first time I created something for the web was in junior high school, when I built my first Blogspot site for a final assignment. That experience of publishing something of my own was a pivotal moment. While high school was more focused on hardware and tweaking my gaming laptop, the desire to understand computers on a deeper level led me to pursue a degree in Informatics Engineering at the University of Surabaya (UBAYA).
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        At UBAYA, my passion solidified into a career path. Through the Information Management & Enterprise System (IMES) program, I was exposed to a wide array of technologies. I built foundational knowledge with C# and object-oriented principles, delved into distributed programming with C++, and explored my creative side with tools like GIMP, Inkscape, and FL Studio. My coursework in native (Kotlin) and hybrid mobile development (Flutter, React Native) gave me a versatile skill set, culminating in a final graduation project built with Flutter. This comprehensive education cemented my love for building technology, and I've been creating ever since.

                <div>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-200 mb-4">My Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        For me, the most satisfying part of being a developer is that moment of breakthrough. After staring at the same error for hours, that feeling when you finally find the solution and everything clicks into place is unbeatable. It's that feeling of completing the puzzle that I truly enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want the people using my applications to have that same feeling of satisfaction. Technology shouldn't be frustrating. It should be responsive, smooth to look at, and easy to use. I focus on writing clean code not just for the sake of it, but because it’s the foundation for building a product that works for people, not against them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, I think of my work in Informatics like being a doctor for technology. My goal is to build things that can help many people at once. For me, the best technology is the kind that solves a real problem and makes someone's day just a little bit better.

                    <p>
                        When I'm not immersed in code or design, I'm usually exploring the world through different lenses. You might find me searching for the perfect cup of coffee at a local cafe, getting lost in a compelling podcast on a long walk, or capturing moments through my camera lens. These hobbies help me recharge, find new inspiration, and bring a fresh perspective to my work.
